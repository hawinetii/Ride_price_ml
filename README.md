🚕 Ride Price Estimation System

Mini Machine Learning Project – Semester One

📌 Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end machine learning system designed to estimate the price of a ride based on trip and contextual information. The goal of the project is not to build a perfect pricing model, but to demonstrate practical machine learning thinking: how to frame a real-world problem, design a dataset, prepare data, train models, evaluate results, and reflect on limitations and ethical concerns.

The project follows the complete machine learning workflow taught in Semester One and emphasizes reasoning, interpretability, and clarity over model complexity.

🧠 Problem Statement

Ride prices are influenced by several factors such as trip distance, duration, traffic conditions, time of day, weather, and rider demand. These factors interact in non-linear and sometimes unpredictable ways, making it difficult to define accurate pricing using fixed rules.

This project frames ride price estimation as a supervised machine learning problem, where a model learns pricing patterns from historical ride data and uses those patterns to estimate prices for new, unseen rides.

🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, the following machine learning competencies are demonstrated:

Framing a real-world problem as a machine learning task

Designing a dataset with meaningful numerical and categorical features

Applying the full machine learning workflow

Building and evaluating both regression and classification models

Communicating results clearly through code, visualizations, and explanations

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project was synthetically created to simulate realistic ride-hailing scenarios. All values were generated based on logical assumptions about how ride pricing works in practice.

Number of rows: 150+

Target variable: ride_price (continuous)

Feature types: Numerical and categorical

Features Used and Justification

distance_km
Longer distances naturally increase fuel usage and driver time, leading to higher prices.

duration_min
Ride duration captures time-based pricing, especially in slow traffic conditions.

time_of_day
Prices often vary depending on whether a ride occurs during peak or off-peak hours.

traffic_level
Heavier traffic increases trip time and operational cost.

weather_condition
Poor weather conditions can increase prices due to higher risk and reduced driver availability.

demand_level
High demand is commonly associated with surge pricing mechanisms.

fuel_price
Fuel cost affects operational expenses and indirectly influences ride pricing.

Feature considered but not included:
Gender was intentionally excluded because it is ethically inappropriate and should not influence ride pricing decisions.

🔄 Machine Learning Workflow

The notebook follows a structured machine learning pipeline:

Problem Framing & ML Justification
Defining why machine learning is suitable for this task.

Data Exploration & Understanding
Inspecting the dataset, checking for missing values, inconsistent labels, outliers, and visualizing raw data.

Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and treating outliers.

Regression Model: Ride Price Prediction
Training a Linear Regression model to predict continuous ride prices and evaluating its performance.

Classification Model: High-Cost vs Low-Cost Ride
Creating a binary target and training a Logistic Regression model, evaluated using accuracy and a confusion matrix.

Model Evaluation & Comparison
Comparing regression and classification results and identifying the most influential features.

Ethical & Practical Reflection
Discussing potential risks, biases, and limitations of the system.

🤖 Models Used
Linear Regression

Used to predict continuous ride prices. Evaluation metrics include:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

R² score

Logistic Regression

Used to classify rides as high-cost or low-cost. Evaluation metrics include:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

These models were chosen because they are interpretable and aligned with methods taught in Semester One.

📈 Key Findings

Distance and demand level were the most influential features affecting ride price

Data quality significantly impacted model performance

Simple models were able to learn meaningful pricing behavior

Classification results depended heavily on how the price threshold was defined

⚖️ Ethical and Practical Considerations

Potential unfair pricing: Surge pricing during high demand may disadvantage certain users

Real-world risk: Over-reliance on automated pricing without human oversight

Dataset limitation: Synthetic data may not fully capture real-world complexity
